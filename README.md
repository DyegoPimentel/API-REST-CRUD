# REST API using PHP and MySQL

In this project I create a REST API using PHP, and with this API it's possible to do CRUD in a MySQL database.
This project was developed to demonstrate my technical knowledge in a job interview, where the main objective of the test is to assemble a REST API with CRUD and document the API endpoints.
